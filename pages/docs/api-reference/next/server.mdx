# next/server

`next/server` provides server-only helpers for use in [Middleware](/docs/middleware.md) and [Edge API Routes](/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes.md).

## NextRequest

The `NextRequest` object is an extension of the native [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) interface, with the following added methods and properties:

- `cookies` - A [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) with cookies from the `Request`. See [Using cookies in Edge Middleware](#using-cookies-in-edge-middleware)
- `nextUrl`: Includes an extended, parsed, URL object that gives you access to Next.js specific properties such as `pathname`, `basePath`, `trailingSlash` and `i18n`. Includes the following properties:
  - `basePath` (`string`)
  - `buildId` (`string || undefined`)
  - `defaultLocale` (`string || undefined`)
  - `domainLocale`
    - `defaultLocale`: (`string`)
    - `domain`: (`string`)
    - `http`: (`boolean || undefined`)
    - `locales`: (`string[] || undefined`)
  - `locale` (`string || undefined`)
  - `url` (`URL`)
- `ip`: (`string || undefined`) - Has the IP address of the `Request`. This information is provided by your hosting platform.
- `geo` - Has the geographic location from the `Request`. This information is provided by your hosting platform. Includes the following properties:
  - `city` (`string || undefined`)
  - `country` (`string || undefined`)
  - `region` (`string || undefined`)
  - `latitude` (`string || undefined`)
  - `longitude` (`string || undefined`)

You can use the `NextRequest` object as a direct replacement for the native `Request` interface, giving you more control over how you manipulate the request.

`NextRequest` can be imported from `next/server`:

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
```

## NextFetchEvent

The `NextFetchEvent` object extends the native [`FetchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) object, and includes the [`waitUntil()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent/waitUntil) method.

The `waitUntil()` method can be used to prolong the execution of the function if you have other background work to make.

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from "next/server";

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest, event: NextFetchEvent) {
  event.waitUntil(
    fetch("https://my-analytics-platform.com", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ pathname: req.nextUrl.pathname }),
    })
  );

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

The `NextFetchEvent` object can be imported from `next/server`:

```typescript
import type { NextFetchEvent } from "next/server";
```

## NextResponse

The `NextResponse` class extends the native [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) interface, with the following:

### Public Methods

Public methods are available on an instance of the `NextResponse` class. Depending on your use case, you can create an instance and assign to a variable, then access the following public methods:

- `cookies` - A [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) with the cookies in the `Response`

### Static Methods

The following static methods are available on the `NextResponse` class directly:

- `redirect()` - Returns a `NextResponse` with a redirect set
- `rewrite()` - Returns a `NextResponse` with a rewrite set
- `next()` - Returns a `NextResponse` that will continue the middleware chain

To use the methods above, **you must return the `NextResponse` object** returned. `NextResponse` can be imported from `next/server`:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
```

## userAgent

The `userAgent` helper allows you to interact with the user agent object from the request. It is abstracted from the native `Request` object, and is an opt in feature. It has the following properties:

- `isBot`: (`boolean`) Whether the request comes from a known bot
- `browser`
  - `name`: (`string || undefined`) The name of the browser
  - `version`: (`string || undefined`) The version of the browser, determined dynamically
- `device`
  - `model`: (`string || undefined`) The model of the device, determined dynamically
  - `type`: (`string || undefined`) The type of the browser, can be one of the following values: `console`, `mobile`, `tablet`, `smarttv`, `wearable`, `embedded`, or `undefined`
  - `vendor`: (`string || undefined`) The vendor of the device, determined dynamically
- `engine`
  - `name`: (`string || undefined`) The name of the browser engine, could be one of the following values: `Amaya`, `Blink`, `EdgeHTML`, `Flow`, `Gecko`, `Goanna`, `iCab`, `KHTML`, `Links`, `Lynx`, `NetFront`, `NetSurf`, `Presto`, `Tasman`, `Trident`, `w3m`, `WebKit` or `undefined`
  - `version`: (`string || undefined`) The version of the browser engine, determined dynamically, or `undefined`
- `os`
  - `name`: (`string || undefined`) The name of the OS, could be `undefined`
  - `version`: (`string || undefined`) The version of the OS, determined dynamically, or `undefined`
- `cpu`
  - `architecture`: (`string || undefined`) The architecture of the CPU, could be one of the following values: `68k`, `amd64`, `arm`, `arm64`, `armhf`, `avr`, `ia32`, `ia64`, `irix`, `irix64`, `mips`, `mips64`, `pa-risc`, `ppc`, `sparc`, `sparc64` or `undefined`

`userAgent` can be imported from `next/server`:

```typescript
import { userAgent } from "next/server";
```

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse, userAgent } from "next/server";

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const url = request.nextUrl;
  const { device } = userAgent(request);
  const viewport = device.type === "mobile" ? "mobile" : "desktop";
  url.searchParams.set("viewport", viewport);
  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
}
```

## FAQ

### Why does `redirect` use 307 and 308?

When using `redirect()` you may notice that the status codes used are `307` for a temporary redirect, and `308` for a permanent redirect. While traditionally a `302` was used for a temporary redirect, and a `301` for a permanent redirect, many browsers changed the request method of the redirect, from a `POST` to `GET` request when using a `302`, regardless of the origins request method.

Taking the following example of a redirect from `/users` to `/people`, if you make a `POST` request to `/users` to create a new user, and are conforming to a `302` temporary redirect, the request method will be changed from a `POST` to a `GET` request. This doesn't make sense, as to create a new user, you should be making a `POST` request to `/people`, and not a `GET` request.

The introduction of the `307` status code means that the request method is preserved as `POST`.

- `302` - Temporary redirect, will change the request method from `POST` to `GET`
- `307` - Temporary redirect, will preserve the request method as `POST`

The `redirect()` method uses a `307` by default, instead of a `302` temporary redirect, meaning your requests will _always_ be preserved as `POST` requests.

If you want to cause a `GET` response to a `POST` request, use `303`.

### How do I access Environment Variables?

`process.env` can be used to access [Environment Variables](/docs/basic-features/environment-variables.md) from Edge Middleware. They are evaluated during `next build`:

| Works                                                        | Does **not** work                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `console.log(process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE)`                   | `const getEnv = name => process.env[name]` |
| `const { MY_ENV_VARIABLE } = process.env`                    |                                            |
| `const { "MY-ENV-VARIABLE": MY_ENV_VARIABLE } = process.env` |                                            |

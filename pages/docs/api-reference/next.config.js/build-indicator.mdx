description: In development mode, pages include an indicator to let you know if your new code it's being compiled. You can opt-out of it here.

# Build indicator

When you edit your code, and Next.js is compiling the application, a compilation indicator appears in the bottom right corner of the page.

> **Note:** This indicator is only present in development mode and will not appear when building and running the app in production mode.

In some cases this indicator can be misplaced on your page, for example, when conflicting with a chat launcher. To change its position, open `next.config.js` and set the `buildActivityPosition` in the `devIndicators` object to `bottom-right` (default), `bottom-left`, `top-right` or `top-left`:

```js
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivityPosition: "bottom-right",
  },
};
```

In some cases this indicator might not be useful for you. To remove it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `buildActivity` config in `devIndicators` object:

```js
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false,
  },
};
```

import DocsLayout from "@components/DocsLayout";
export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;

# getStaticPaths

If a page has [Dynamic Routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md) and uses `getStaticProps`, it needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated.

When you export a function called `getStaticPaths` (Static Site Generation) from a page that uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.

```jsx
// pages/posts/[id].js

// Generates `/posts/1` and `/posts/2`
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [{ params: { id: "1" } }, { params: { id: "2" } }],
    fallback: false, // can also be true or 'blocking'
  };
}

// `getStaticPaths` requires using `getStaticProps`
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    // Passed to the page component as props
    props: { post: {} },
  };
}

export default function Post({ post }) {
  // Render post...
}
```

The [`getStaticPaths` API reference](/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths.md) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticPaths`.

## When should I use getStaticPaths?

You should use `getStaticPaths` if you’re statically pre-rendering pages that use dynamic routes and:

- The data comes from a headless CMS
- The data comes from a database
- The data comes from the filesystem
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance

## When does getStaticPaths run

`getStaticPaths` will only run during build in production, it will not be called during runtime. You can validate code written inside `getStaticPaths` is removed from the client-side bundle [with this tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).

### How does getStaticProps run with regards to getStaticPaths

- `getStaticProps` runs during `next build` for any `paths` returned during build
- `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `fallback: true`
- `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using `fallback: blocking`

## Where can I use getStaticPaths

- `getStaticPaths` **must** be used with `getStaticProps`
- You **cannot** use `getStaticPaths` with [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props.md)
- You can export `getStaticPaths` from a [Dynamic Route](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes.md) that also uses `getStaticProps`
- You **cannot** export `getStaticPaths` from non-page file (e.g. your `components` folder)
- You must export `getStaticPaths` as a standalone function, and not a property of the page component

## Runs on every request in development

In development (`next dev`), `getStaticPaths` will be called on every request.

## Generating paths on-demand

`getStaticPaths` allows you to control which pages are generated during the build instead of on-demand with [`fallback`](/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths.md#fallback-blocking). Generating more pages during a build will cause slower builds.

You can defer generating all pages on-demand by returning an empty array for `paths`. This can be especially helpful when deploying your Next.js application to multiple environments. For example, you can have faster builds by generating all pages on-demand for previews (but not production builds). This is helpful for sites with hundreds/thousands of static pages.

```jsx
// pages/posts/[id].js

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // When this is true (in preview environments) don't
  // prerender any static pages
  // (faster builds, but slower initial page load)
  if (process.env.SKIP_BUILD_STATIC_GENERATION) {
    return {
      paths: [],
      fallback: "blocking",
    };
  }

  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch("https://.../posts");
  const posts = await res.json();

  // Get the paths we want to prerender based on posts
  // In production environments, prerender all pages
  // (slower builds, but faster initial page load)
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }));

  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404
  return { paths, fallback: false };
}
```
